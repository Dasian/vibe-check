Sup john, if you wanna download this just press the green code button and download a zip file.
To run you'd need python3 installed. 

Open a cmd prompt or powershel or whatever you can use to create a python3 shell (run 'python3' in 
the terminal and you should be in a shell, type 'quit()' to get out). 

To run you just need to change the directory to the folder with the code
(cd some/path/here) and run 'python3 vibe-check.py'. 

There are probably some libraries you need to install so also run 'pip3 PySimpleGUI' in the terminal.
Repeat for any other libraries that they're mad at you for.

If this doesn't work it makes sense, these are pretty shit instructions and I'll just figure it out tomorrow.
